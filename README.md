## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. This repository is designed to help you get hands-on experience with Rust through a series of exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with Rust, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and start working on the exercises:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-learning-repo.git
cd rust-learning-repo
```

## Exercises

The exercises are organized into different categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of Rust. You can find the exercises in the `exercises` directory. Each exercise comes with a README file that explains the task and provides hints.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have an idea for a new exercise or improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
